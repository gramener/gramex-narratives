# Ordered series

E.g. population by age group. It has a number (population) and a label (age group) whose order matters.

## Narratives

- `maxValue`: "The highest population is at age group 30-35."
- `minValue`: "The lowest population is at age group 80-85."
- `maxGrowth`: "It's the highest growth in 3 months."
- `maxDiff`: "It's the biggest rise in 3 months."
- `distribution`:
  - "It's a steadily falling distribution with peak at age group 0-5."
  - "It's a bell curve with a peak at age group 30-35, skewed slightly to the left."
  - "It's a bi-modal distribution with peaks at age group 20-25 and 60-65"
  - "It's a multi-modal distribution"
  - ...
- `runs`: "It steadily decreased from age group 30-35 to 85-90." if `runs >= minRuns`
- `split`: "Population before age group 40-45 is much higher than after."
- `splitVariance`: "Population before age group 40-45 fluctuates much more than after."
- `range`: "95% of population ranges from 4M to 15M."
- `outliers`: "But the population at age groups 80-85 and 85-90 is only 0.5M and 0.2M."
- `rangeGroup`: "80% of the population is between age group 15-20 and 55-60."
- `outlierGroup`: "But there is a 0.5M population at age group 80-85 and 0.2M at age group 85-90."
